# Android Studio Setup

- Download Android Studio 2.2.3 for Linux.

- Unpack the ZIP file in your home directory (for example, in
  `~/tools`).

- IMPORTANT: you need to delete the downloaded ZIP file now, because
  otherwise your disk space will be quickly exceeded, leading to
  errors later.

- Navigate to the `android-studio/bin` directory and execute
  `./studio.sh`

- The Wizard will guide you through the rest of the setup.

- Choose not to import settings from a previous installation.

- Choose "Standard" installation.

- The step "Downloading Components" will take a few minutes to
  complete.

- Unregistered VCS root detected -> ignore for now.

- "Help" -> "Edit Custom Properties..." then edit the config file by
  adding:
```
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# IDEA can copy library .jar files to prevent their locking.

idea.jars.nocopy=false
```
