## Intro to XML

- Required for building the GUI
  - GUI = graphical user interface

- XML is a text-based file format
  - XML = eXtensible Markup Language
  - Closely related to HTML

- Example:

```
<computer>
  <processor>64-bit, 4 cores</processor>
  <mainboard>..</mainboard>
  <graphicscard>..<graphicscard>
</computer>
```

- XML files define a tree structure
  - Elements may be nested within each other
  - An element has at most one parent
  - Example above: the "computer" element is the parent of the "mainboard" element

### Attributes

- Elements in an XML document may have *attributes*

### Real Example (Android)
